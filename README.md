# 🤖 Project Astacus
*Revolutionizing Robotics with Multi-Gait Mobility and AI Integration*

Astacus is a cutting-edge hexapod robot that brings together advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and multi-gait mobility. Designed for both practical applications and fun, Astacus offers a unique blend of custom features, autonomous behaviors, and versatile control modes.

**⚠️ Note:** *Project Astacus is still a work in progress. Not all features are fully implemented yet, but I are actively developing and expanding its capabilities.*

## 🚀 Features
### 🦾 **Hexapod Design**
Astacus stands on six precision-engineered legs, offering superior stability and maneuverability across various terrains.

### ⚙️ **Hot-Swappable Gaits**
Easily switch between multiple walking patterns to adapt to different environments and tasks:
- **Wave Gait**: Slow and steady, perfect for uneven surfaces.
- **Ripple Gait**: Efficient for speed and smoother motion.
- **Tripod Gait**: Optimal for high-speed movement across flat terrain.
- **Transition Gait**: Seamless shifts between different gaits based on environmental conditions.

### 🤖 **LLM Integration (Chat-GPT 4.0)**
Astacus leverages ChatGPT 4.0 to communicate intelligently with its environment and user, providing real-time feedback and performing complex tasks through natural language understanding.

### 🎙️ **AI Voice Generation**
Equipped with state-of-the-art text-to-speech, Astacus can speak back to you with lifelike AI-generated voices.

### 🔗 **Connectivity**
- **Bluetooth 5.3**: Seamlessly control Astacus via wireless controller or smartphone app.
- **WiFi 6**: Stay connected and stream live data or control remotely with ultra-fast wireless networking.

### 🔍 **Autonomous Patrolling**
Astacus autonomously navigates its surroundings, actively patrolling for specified targets or stimuli in real-time.

### 💡 **LED Illumination**
Dynamic LED lighting brings Astacus to life, offering customizable patterns for both aesthetic flair and functional feedback.

### 🦶 **Pressure-Sensitive Feet**
Astacus’s feet are equipped with sensors to detect pressure changes, enhancing its ability to interact with uneven surfaces or objects.

### 🔦 **Laser Pin Pointing**
A precision laser pointer allows Astacus to target and highlight specific points or objects in its environment.

### 🎮 **Wireless Controller**
Take full control of Astacus through an ergonomic wireless controller or smartphone app for real-time interaction.

### 🧠 **Facial Recognition**
With built-in facial recognition, Astacus can identify and track individuals, adding a layer of personalization and interaction.

### 🔧 **Custom Designed PCB**
A custom-printed circuit board (PCB) powers Astacus, ensuring optimal performance and modular upgradability.

### 🗡️ **Omni-Directional “Attacking”**
Astacus can actively engage targets from all directions, utilizing its omni-directional mobility to simulate defense or “attack” routines.

### 📷 **Audio Visual Feeds**
Stream live video and audio to keep track of Astacus’s perspective and surroundings.
